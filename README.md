## Local-Weather

A simple python-flask weather application utilizing the Forecast.io api.

Simply lays out the minutely and hourly forecast for whatever location you want with Bootstrap's mobile-first front end framework.

Setup:
+ Edit lat and lon in views.py
+ Add forecast.io api keys
+ Custom CSS
+ Edit lat and lon for radar embed


Uses:
+ [Forecast.io API](http://forecast.io)
+ [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
+ [Animated Climacons](http://blog.forecast.io/skycons-unobtrustive-animated-weather-icons/)
+ [Weather Icons](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)


Todo:
+ Really need to setup asynchronous call to Forecast.io for up-to-date data without refresh.
+ Adding AngularJS is in the works.
